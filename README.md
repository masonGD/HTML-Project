<h1>THE BIG SECRET</h1>

<p>Never... EVER order a double cheese burger. 9/10's they give you 2 patties ragardless. If you ask, they charge you.</p>

    <summary>What is the wait time like?</summary>
    Usually 5-10 minutes unless you go during a rush.

<details>
    <summary>What are the "Scoopy tokens for?</summary>
    If you save up 10 you can either get a free kids meal or a piece of Culvers merchandise (depending on location).
</details>
     
<details>
    <summary>What is the best main dish?</summary>
    If you're only feelings peckish the chicken tender basket is the way to go. If you are starving the butter-burger basket is your best friend.
</details>
     
<details>
    <summary>What is the best side?</summary>
    The cheese curds from Culvers are amazing, however; these come at an upcharge. If you're on a budget the fries are great as well. The onion rings often leave me with regret and are quite expensive.

  <h1>My mission for you:</h1>
     <p>Everytime someone goes through the Culver's drive through they ask for their name for the order. One day, I decided to start giving them fake names like Reggie, Prince Hubbert, Duncerk, etc. They're doubted be a couple times but you must stay confident and assert your fake name as reality. </p>
     
      <p>While this is fun for me I often find myself thinking of more names than I could use in a lifetime of going to Culvers, That's where you come in. When you're feeling brave take one of these names for a spin (some are Culvers related, some are silly):</p>
     
     <p>Possible fake names:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cole Vers</li>
    <li>Patty Burgur</li>
    <li>Lee Ann Beef</li>
    <li>Hun Greeman</li>
    <li>Sal Ted Fry</li>
    <li>Dr. Wheels</li>
    <li>Bubu</li>
    <li>Father Jo-jo</li>
    <li>J. Peg</li>
    <li>Mr./Ms. (insert your last name here)</li>
    <li>Junk Jr.</li>
    <li>(insert celebrity name)</li>
    <li>Agent Ben Burgur</li>
    
</ul>
